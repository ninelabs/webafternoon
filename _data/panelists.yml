  bio: |
    Prior to forming the strategic business consultancy Anwyl Ltd. LLC in 2003, Rick previously founded, and for 18 years operated Executive Arts Inc. (EAI), an Atlanta based Corporate Communications Design firm. In 1994, he founded Elemental Interactive, a technology-based web and software firm, specializing in online investor communications. He later sold Elemental Interactive to Grey Global, Inc. in 1999 and EAI in 2003 to private investors.

    Rick’s extensive experience spans 35 plus years in the graphic communications field. Early in his career Rick gained a reputation as an outstanding conceptual strategist and designer for organizations at a crossroads. His thumbprints are on some of the more notable corporate stories of the last several decades. From the launch of CNN, to the leverage buyout of RJR Nabisco, the IPO of Ralph Lauren and Accenture to the Lou Gerstner turnaround of IBM, the Coca-Cola Company and the Roberto Goizueta era to the rebranding of GANNETT Media, Rick has been instrumental in quietly helping reshape and redefine brands and the manner in which they communicate.

    _“I‘ve been extremely fortunate in having had the opportunity to work with some of the finest communication professionals in the business. It has been their confidence, trust, and immeasurable contributions, to what is inherently a collaborative process, that have allowed the successes I’ve enjoyed.”_

    Throughout Rick’s career, his clients’ work has consistently been acknowledged by the industry and featured in virtually every major publication. In 2009 he was honored as an AIGA Fellow; he is a sought after guest lecturer and instructor, and has juried everything from The New York One Show to the Wynonna Park Elementary 4th grade art exhibition.

    Today, he is a corporate business and brand strategy consultant assisting corporations as well as design and communications firms. Among his other activities, he is founder and was the executive director of the Atlanta-based Center for Design Study, a non-profit foundation dedicated to fostering excellence within all disciplines of design practice. The Center was responsible for acquiring and preserving the legendary CBS Cafeteria Wall, the Gastrotypographicalassemblage, now permanently housed at Culinary Institute of America’s New York Hyde Park campus.

    He currently resides with his family on a 37-acre farm outside of Atlanta, Georgia. He is an avid outdoor enthusiast, breeds Labrador Retrievers, and is an accomplished fly fisherman and embarrassingly poor golfer.
