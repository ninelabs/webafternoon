  talk-title: Designing for Happy Companies
  talk-description: |
    Or&hellip; _How Getting Weird and Finding a Purpose Created a Design Mission_ &mdash; Meg Lewis, the world’s happiest person, shares her hilarious life journey and how it led to Meg finding her purpose. She will discuss the benefits of leveraging your quirks to create a career mission. You’ll laugh and cry your way to a happy ending during this unconventional, fun talk!
  interview: |
    **So, Meg...we checked out your portfolio, and your work is rad. We also couldn’t help but notice your tattoos, which are ALSO rad. Do you design your own?**

    I absolutely did not design my own. I wouldn’t be able to put enough faith in my own work to do that. Rather, I had friends, illustrators and tattoo artists design them!

    **Why did you name your company “Ghostly Ferns?”**

    Before I was a designer, I owned an online vintage shop. I had hundreds of products and I was constantly spending my time picking out names for each piece. My favorite dress I ever sold was one I called the “Ghostly Ferns dress,” because it had faded little ferns on the pattern. When I closed my vintage shop to open my design studio, I found that, once again, I needed a name. I thought Ghostly Ferns was a perfect homage to my past adventure, and, as it turns out, it’s pretty fitting because so many plants have died in the Ghostly Ferns studio. We’re definitely haunted by quite a few ferns.

    **Can you describe your creative process a bit?**

    Sheesh, you aren’t going to make this easy for me, are you? I don’t particularly have a die-hard everyday process because I rarely do the same kind of project twice. The most important thing for me to do, personally, is wait to start the design process until I get a surge of creativity. Unfortunately, I can’t control when that happens. Sometimes it’ll hit me at 10:00am, other times it happens late at night. I’ve learned to realize that I don’t do very good work when I’m not in the mood. I’m fortunate enough as a freelancer to be able to wait until the time is just right for every project.

    **What are some questions you ask when considering taking on a new project?**

    I like to figure out why the potential client contacted me. Do they even understand what I do, or are they just contacting a bunch of random designers? I also want to know why their brand is truly working toward making the world a better place. I try my best to figure out if they’re full of bologna or if there’s really heart and soul behind their company.

    **What industry sites and blogs do you read regularly?**

    I’m bad at reading the internet. I typically don’t go directly to blogs or websites to read content. Rather, I wait for one of my trusty internet pals to post something interesting. If it’s a person whom I trust that is vouching for an article or post, it means a lot to me and I’ll read it.

    **Which apps do you use daily?**

    I recently got into the stock market and am constantly checking Stash and Robinhood. I’m also a hardcore Swarm and Foursquare user, which works only because all of my friends use them too. As for games, I’m really into Neko Atsume.

    **Do you have a favorite design tool? Why?**

    100% Sketch, forever and always. Sketch changed my life so much and made every single part of my job as a UI, web, UX, whatever designer better. It’s put less strain on the designer/developer relationship as well. I just love it so much!


    **Who are some of your design heroes?**

    - [Adi Goodrich](http://www.adigoodrich.com) brings my imagination to life in physical spaces. I love her work so much!
    - [Will Bryant](http://www.willbryant.com) is my cool vibes soul brother and I’ll forever be a huge fan.
    - [Shawna X](http://work.shawna-x.com)’s work is on a completely different level and always takes my breath away.

    Long story short: designers who use color and happiness with elements of weird are always okay in my book.


    **How do you stay on top of design trends?**

    I look at [Site Inspire](http://www.siteinspire.com) a whole bunch to stay on top of what the cool kids are doing. Otherwise, I read [A Book Apart](http://abookapart.com) books for actual knowledge.

    **If you had a magic wand and could create the perfect job, what would the job description be?**

    Independent woman needed to design experience for the Museum of Farts. Must be an aspiring illusionist and lover of mimes. Extensive knowledge of N’SYNC lyrics required. Proficiency in ribbon dancing is a plus. Must be okay touching butts.

    **Is there anything you’d like to say to Adobe Flash before it goes away for good?**

    You made so much magic happen!

    **Do you have a celebrity doppleganger? If so, who is it?**

    Ugh, someone’s mom once told me I look like Bette Midler, and I’ve never been able to let that go.

    **We’ve been wondering, Is a picture actually worth a thousand words?**

    I have definitely used at least a thousand words to describe this picture of organist Cameron Carpenter. He deserves so many words, good and bad.

    **Why aren’t there any B-sized batteries around?**

    Apparently, there used to be B batteries but no one used them and they became extinct, like dinosaurs.

    Only one person will ever wear the title of Adobe’s first creative resident, and her name is Becky Simpson, lettering and illustration stylist extraordinaire. Becky is an illustrator, author, and graphic designer based in Austin, Texas, whose work reflects her passion for connection, process, and play. After authoring and illustrating her first book, I’d Rather Be Short, Becky has spent the last year at Adobe, building an impressive body of work while showing off what today’s hottest tools and processes can really do to impact design. The focus of her work Adobe is on the creative process of designing a sustainable illustration business, and in all of her spare time she’s been writing her second book, The Roommate Book.

    Becky’s work is regularly copied, but rarely ignored. She's at the forefront of the lettering and illustration styles that are taking brands by storm. She's been featured in Zooey Deschanels' Hello Giggles, The Great Discontent, Parade Magazine, Buzzfeed, Man Repeller, and countless other publications including Design Milk, Refinery 29, Lifehacker, 99U, The Five on Fox News, Adobe Create (Book Process), Adobe Create (Lessons Learned from 100 Day Project), Houston Chronicle, Quartz, KWTX, Cedar Rapids Gazette, Waco Trib, Camille Styles, The Tangential, Jessica and Krystal, The Girls with Glasses, Anthology, B is for Bonnie, Adobe Creative Cloud (Speaking at MAX).

  talk-title: Celebrate the Process of Getting Things Done
  talk-description: |
    We live in a world of information overload. We’re constantly forced to curate our lives because we know that if we don’t, someone else will. Those of us who have found our home in creative industries are also learning how to hone our skills, manage our time, and coddle the vision that got us here in the first place.

    So, with all of these distractions and opportunities, how do you force yourself to stay focused and just get the work done? Becky will talk about how she wrote and illustrated two books, created a backlog of art for 100 days, and is building a product company based on her illustrations. She will share her *six game-changing lessons* that anyone can use to prioritize focus, hunker down, and get started creating.
  interview: |
    **First off, you were born and raised in Iowa. Ron Livingston, the main character in the world’s best movie, “Office Space,” is also from Iowa. Do you know him?**

    Ha! No, I wish. He’s actually from Cedar Rapids, which is near me. Ashton Kutcher is also from there. Iowans love to support Iowan celebrities!

    **You’ve authored a book, are working on your second one, and you’re currently a creative resident for Adobe. What’s next?**

    After my residency is up this spring, I’m going to be launching my own product line. I’m so excited and I’m trying not to feel (too) overwhelmed. The plan is to start with prints and then slowly expand the product offerings. My goal is to build a profitable product line slowly and steadily.

    **Can you describe your creative process?**

    Well, that’s a loaded question! Honestly, as cliche as it sounds, I pretty much just do the work. The process looks different for each project, but my common practice is to start with concepts. My favorite work is creating content, and I typically start with little thoughts that turn into “when I massage this out, what could it become?” In general, I don’t use a pencil, because I like committing to my marks. I like that my art is quirky; I understand that the quirks are what make it charming. I’m not crippled by comparison and I usually just do my own thing. I don’t really fear the idea that I might not be the best at what I do; instead, I think my biggest fear is not reaching my own potential. It’s that fear that drives me, creatively and otherwise.

    **How do you stay on top of design trends?**

    Honestly, I really don’t. It’s not that I’m actively opposed to the idea, I just don’t participate much in that world. I am so saturated with art and design all the time that I try not to engage beyond that. I also feel like so much, trend-wise, is extraordinarily overdone, and I don’t want to be influenced by quickly-fading styles. I love working on stuff that’s fun and easy for me, things that are in my niche. I do what feels most fun and playful at the time, and I think it works.

    **Who are some of your heroes in the industry?**

    - [Christoph Niemann](http://www.christophniemann.com)
    - [Marc Johns](http://www.marcjohns.com)
    - [Julia Rothman](http://www.juliarothman.com/#1)
    - [Will Bryant](http://www.willbryant.com)
    - [Marissa Moss](http://www.marissamoss.com)

    **Which industry sites/blogs do you read regularly?**

    - [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org)
    - [My Morning Routine](http://mymorningroutine.com)
    - [Brain Sponge](http://brainspongeblog.com)

    **Which apps do you use daily?**

    - [Adobe Capture](http://www.adobe.com/products/capture.html) (for color palettes and vectorizing)
    - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/beckymsimps/) (this is my favorite form of social media)
    - [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) (for meditation)
    - [Simple Note](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simplenote/id289429962?mt=8) (for note taking)
    - [Podcasts](http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/)
    - [Audible](http://www.audible.com)

    **Do you have a favorite design tool? Why?**

    - A Pen/marker and paper (it’s lo-fi, I know, but it works)
    - [Wacom Intuos tablet](http://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets) (it’s great for editing)

    **If you had a magic wand and could create the perfect job, what would the job description be?**

    The perfect job would give me the freedom to have my own line of products that’s mainly managed by automated shipping and marketing systems. Basically, I’d create the art while other people and systems take care of the rest of the details. In a perfect world, my income wouldn’t be contingent on the time spent on work. I’d definitely love the flexibility to travel, teach, and do other things. In short, I’d say the perfect job would be one in which I make money from art & have flexibility.

    **Do you have a celebrity doppleganger? If so, who is it?**

    I would want it to be Emily Blunt. If I had someone playing me in a movie, I’d want it to be Parker Posie, Lizzy Kaplan, Emily Blunt, or Winona Ryder. I’ve been told I look like Sarah Jessica Parker, although I think that’s debatable.

    **Becky, you’re so smart, we just have to ask you: why doesn’t glue stick to the bottle?**

    Just to give us something to ponder, because, let’s be real, what else are we gonna think about if we can’t ask deep questions like this. Donald Trump is already owning the media, and there’s nothing else left.

    **One last thing: what was the greatest thing before sliced bread?**

    Probably blenders.

    After over 20 years in the industry, you could say Jason Pamental knows a thing or two about how to build a successful design career. Along with serving as Director of Design &amp; Product Experience at [Fresh Tilled Soil](http://www.freshtilledsoil.com/), a design house just outside of Boston, MA, Jason is also the author of [Responsive Typography](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034063.do) (from O’Reilly), and the host of [Talking Drupal](http://www.talkingdrupal.com/), a weekly podcast focused on all things Drupal and eCommerce.

    Self described as a web & typography nerd who specializes in being a generalist, Jason has an impressive portfolio of work that is truly in a league of its own. His role at FTS involves leading client workshops, defining design processes, and serving as a day-to-day touchpoint and ‘block-remover’ for project teams. He has led groundbreaking responsive redesigns for the likes of Yale, the NFL, and numerous Fortune 500 companies.

    Jason is a designer who is truly at the forefront of what’s next in web design and typography, and the opportunity to learn from him about his processes and pattern of thinking can’t be missed. He’s excited to speak at Web Afternoon - Design Edition, and to encourage fellow designers on toward excellence in all they do.
  talk-title: Once Upon a Drop Cap (When Words Were the Experience & Letters Were Your Voice)
  talk-description: |
    What we have to say has always been intimately intertwined with how we say it. Design is about communicating those ideas and influencing users’ behavior, so it follows that influence is imparted largely by how we design. For all our intellectual complexity, our brains are still wired to make near-instant judgements about the value and importance of the message we are receiving based on how that message appears.

    Thankfully, most of us are still familiar enough with actual books to remember the feel of paper under our fingers, the smell of the ink, the elegant transitions from one idea to the next -- all in service of the story. While pixels remain odorless, there’s much more we can do than just deliver a digital message. Practiced typography transforms that message into a compelling experience. Let’s take a journey forward through time and see where typography can take us.
  interview: |
    **First off, you’re a published author. That’s pretty impressive. Are the paparazzi constantly hounding you?**

    Constantly. You have no idea how relentless the fans of good web typography can be. (Full disclosure: I’ve had a couple of instances of people saying, “oh, hey - I know you! I have your book. I should read that!”)


    **You have 20+ years experience in the design field and have worked with clients from the NFL to Ivy League schools. Is there a particular project you’ve tackled that is especially dear to you?**

    There are a couple, separated by about 15 years. I designed two sites for Dennis Connor for his America’s Cup campaigns in 2000 and 2003. I’ve always been a fan of his, and I love to sail, so working with him was really cool. One included a community site that launched over 100,000 online sailboat races, and the later one included the first “live text commentary” online during the challenger series. That was one of my first experiences with something scaling so fast: we went from zero to over 10,000 active users during the first race! Happy to say we never had any problems, and we designed/developed the whole thing ourselves (that was when I had Bathysphere, a small web shop I started with a few friends).

    More recently, though, I have to say my favorite by far would be the [Yale Graduate School of Arts & Sciences](http://gsas.yale.edu) site. That was done ‘soup-to-nuts’ by my wife and me: all the research, user interviews, IA, content strategy, design and development. It took about a year (with a break for the client to work on content), but it was probably the most successful client relationship we’ve ever had. They were great people to work with, and we got to do some really innovative things that helped the school tremendously.


    **Can you describe your creative process?**

    Two words: carefully paced! I like to structure projects for lots of smaller interactions, asking clients a smaller set of questions at any given time. This helps guide them through the design process, and gives us lots of chances to educate, understand, and build relationships with our clients. It works wonders to build trust, and ensures we don’t get off-track.

    There’s a heavy focus on reviewing and iterating with site maps, content structures, and navigation prototypes. I also find using [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es) to be helpful as a way to start the design exploration so the client only has to think about and answer a few questions at at time, like type combinations, color, image treatment, and form elements.

    We move from there to an interior page or screen, and work up/out to the main screen or home page. That way we only have to work on one design direction once we get past the Style Tile stage. It’s a way more effective use of time, budget, and attention.

    I had someone use the analogy once of client trust being like a cup, and every interaction you have will either fill it more, or slosh a bit over the edge. The more interactions you have, the more opportunities there are to fill the cup a bit, or make corrections for a misstep from an earlier stage. If you can end the project with a full cup, you’ve got a really strong relationship that will likely carry forward to many more projects in the future.


    **What are some questions you ask when considering taking on a new project?**

    - What is the goal of the project (rather than ‘what do you want us to design/build)?
    - Who is it for and what do they need to do?
    - What else is going on in your organization? What pains do you have?

    I find that by asking these kinds of questions we can get behind the “what” of a request and dig into why they think they need that “thing.” Many times, it’s the wrong “thing,” and we can help figure that out by digging into what prompted them to call in the first place. If all they want is a simple brochure site, it’s probably not a good fit. But if you look at it as a business tool that can help with marketing, sales, customer relations, communication, and internal collaboration, THEN you have something interesting that can deliver WAY more value for the client.


    **How do you stay on top of design trends?**

    I prefer to stay off of them, actually. I do read a lot, so I see loads of trends come through Twitter, newsletters, the “top 17 best ________-design-trend designs” posts, and whatnot. However, there have been a lot of really bad trends (giant photo with big text overlay with an outlined button, anyone?), so I try to get our designers to look past that. It’s not that photos are bad, but clients want their sites to be successful and stand out, and that may not be the right way to go about it.


    **Which industry sites and blogs do you read regularly?**

    - UX & design posts on [Medium](https://medium.com) (daily)
    - [InVision blog](http://blog.invisionapp.com) (weekly)
    - [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com) (not often enough!)
    - Articles I find in various weekly emails from [Atomic.io](https://atomic.io), [Product Design Weekly](http://designweekly.atomic.io), [NNGroup](https://www.nngroup.com), [UIE](https://www.uie.com)
    - [.Net Magazine](https://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/design/net-magazine-subscription/#digital)
    - [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com)

    I can fairly say that I read 3-5 articles a day at a minimum (sometimes they may be a 2-3 minute read, some are longer). That’s my own commitment to learning. If I don’t learn something new every day, it feels like a lost opportunity.


    **What apps do you use daily?**

    - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jpamental/) (daily morning creativity challenge!)
    - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=jpamental&src=typd)
    - Podcasts (work commute!)
    - [Slack](http://slack.com) (office communication, plus a few others on UX, product management, typography, and design)
    - [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com)
    - [Photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com)
    - [Coda](https://panic.com/coda/)

    - Every web browser ever
    - [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/) (all the presentations!)
    - [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)


    **Do you have a favorite design tool? Why?**

    - A pencil & a sketch book - I have dozens going back to my first semester of Graphic Design. You have unlimited chances to undo when you’re sketching because you can always go look at what you did on the previous page. It’s too easy to lose the evolution of your thought process when you work only digitally.
    - [Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) - I know it best.
    - [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) - I’m trying to learn more as a Sketch user. I like what I know, but I’m just not as good with it as I am other programs, so it can slow me down.


    **Who are some of your design heroes?**

    - [Erik Spiekermann](http://spiekermann.com/en/) he’s first type designer I ever knew by name and author of the first book on typography I ever bought: [Stop Stealing Sheep](http://www.amazon.com/Stop-Stealing-Sheep-Works-Edition/dp/0201703394)
    - [Paul Rand](http://www.paul-rand.com) for his writing as much as his design
    - [James Victore](http://jamesvictore.com) based on a film interview of him done by Hillman Curtis
    - [Mark Boulton](http://www.markboultondesign.com) for being a really thoughtful designer, and for the amazing work he’s doing to remake the design language of Monotype.
    - [Dan Mall](http://www.danielmall.com) for being the kind of designer/speaker/teacher that I’ve tried hard to emulate
    - [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com) & [Ethan Marcotte](http://ethanmarcotte.com) for making better design possible on the web with constant prompting and guidance for the web community as a whole


    **If you had a magic wand and could create the perfect job, what would the job description be?**

    It may well be the one I have now! It’s taken me a while to realize it, but I think that I’m a much better director/guide/teacher of design and web tech than I am a doer. I don’t think I’m a bad designer or developer, but I know there are many others who are better than I. However, I can almost always help them do whatever it is they’re doing BETTER. I’m very good at understanding clients and explaining hard concepts to them. I’ve been a blend of designer, strategist, and technologist for many years, but this is the first company I’ve found where I’m not the only one. Being able to shape the design process and see it applied across the whole team is pretty fantastic.


    **Is there anything you’d like to say to Adobe Flash before it goes away for good?**

    So long and thanks for all the fish?

    Honestly, as much trouble as it’s caused me over the years, we also did some pretty amazing stuff with it: a modular, interactive educational piece for a “green” apartment building in NYC, a video-interview application for a hiring platform, and a data-driven print-on-demand sail quote application for North Sails that drove their quoting process for about 10 years. Pretty cool stuff, even if it did have a habit of blowing up my web browser whenever ads ran too long.


    **You seem like a really smart guy, so we have to ask: what happens if you get scared half to death twice?**

    You are only ¼ alive


    **That’s profound. Ok, one more: if money doesn’t grow on trees, why do banks have branches?**

    Because calling them ‘tentacles’ is too creepy

    Do you love Spotify or Apple Music? If so, you have Hannah Donovan to thank for your virtually limitless supply of music streaming. Hannah started with Last.fm in 2006 when music streaming and discovery were in their infancy, where she ultimately led a team to create the first compelling user experience for music on the web. From her time running her own startup at This Is My Jam, to building Last.fm, to working in MTV's product incubator, and now building Drip, she's been there, done that, and she has the resume to prove it.

    Hannah is currently the Product Designer at Drip, “a new kind of fan club for music and culture.” She is also a well-known speaker who lives at the intersection of big data, big communities, human curation, and the design that ties it all together. She's been working with discovery and curation since her time leading the design team at Last.fm in 2006. Throughout her career, she's been a part of creating cutting edge interfaces that have gone on to influence entire sections of the app store.

    Hannah will be sharing real-world tips and case studies to help you understand how to design for content, both for user-generated and user-curated product experience. Her real-world tips and battle stories are not to be missed.
  talk-title: Souls & Machines&colon; Designing the Future of Content
  talk-description: |
    Not too long ago, it seemed like big data and collaborative filtering were going to solve our desires for discovery and inspiration. At the same time, platforms dedicated to new methods of self expression – music, writing, video, etc. – have matured, and their new forms of content have become mainstays of our culture.

    Today, content companies are adapting to become digital products, and tech companies are learning to make content. How does a product designer navigate this changing landscape? What are the answers to questions like “humans vs. computers,” “pro vs. user-generated content,” and “opinion vs. democracy?” These questions and more will be answered through case studies, experiments, and (of course) stories.       Come to learn, stay for the fun!
  interview: |
    **You’ve been doing this design thing for a LONG time, which is funny to say because you’re so young! How old were you when you knew you wanted to pursue design as your career?**

    About ten. My dad and I were messing around with a printing press my parents had in their garage. I asked him what the job was called where you put shapes and color and type together. “Graphic artist,” my dad responded. Excited that such a profession existed I announced, “That’s what I want to be when I grow up.” My dad looked me in the eye and said firmly, “No, you don’t. You want to be a creative director.” My dad was pretty cool for the ‘80s.

    **I checked out your website, and it’s obvious you have been involved with many really cool projects all over the world! Is there one that’s especially meaningful to you?**

    Aw, thanks! That makes me smile. They’re all meaningful to me in different ways. Both Last.fm and This Is My Jam were unforgettable, roller-coaster-like experiences. I learned so much, so fast, with both of those projects. Drip is shaping up to be similar ride!

    **Token question alert! Can you describe your creative process to us a bit?**

    I always start with a lot of research. I talk to people and seek out experiences that might elicit the same feelings or outcomes to the one I want to create. I get pretty gonzo with it. I’ve always been the kind of nerd that likes to go extremely deep on a problem, so I read everything I can about the topic. That creates the right bits of stuff swirling around in my brain. Then, it’s about sitting down every morning and doing the work, even on the days I don’t feel creative. I force myself to do it through habits and rituals. I like to find a beautiful image once a day. I journal a lot. I move. I keep my ‘creative tap on’ by seeking out weird or different experiences and environments that might lead to something unexpected. My best ideas almost always happen in conversation though; I don’t think it’s ever been when I’m at my desk.

    **What industry sites and blogs do you read regularly?**

    I rely heavily on information getting pushed to me through social networks and email. I love email newsletters and subscribe to a lot of them. One of my favorites is Rusty Foster’s “[Today in Tabs](https://tinyletter.com/todayintabs)” for tech/media/culture.

    **Do you have a favorite design tool? Why?**

    Definitely my moleskine. I’m one of those designers that needs to write/draw as I think. Going back to my statement from earlier, that my best ideas happen in the context of a conversation, I think using a sketchbook is a way to have a conversation with myself. After that, it really depends on what I’m designing, but I do have a long-standing love for Illustrator.

    **Who are some of your design heroes?**

    [Paula Scher](http://www.pentagram.com/#/partners/109681). When I came across her work in highschool, it was very inspirational for me, giving me confidence that having a successful design career as a woman in the industry was possible. I go back to [Alan Fletcher](http://alanfletcherarchive.com/biography) often, particularly when I’m stuck, and I love anything pop-culture oriented. Most of the designers I admire today are all contemporaries, pushing aesthetics, technology, and interfaces forward. I’m extremely lucky to even count a lot of them as my friends.

    **What are some questions you ask when considering taking on a new project?**

    They are, in this order: Is it going to be fun? Am I going to learn a lot? Is there good upside? The first two are really informed by the team. The team is everything. The team will make or break the project.

    **How do you stay on top of design trends?**

    I’m in a few different private slack channels with designers, and we share a lot of information that way. Also, most of my friends are designers, which may or may not be a good thing (ha!). Of course I do all the usual things, including following people I admire and reading a lot of articles, but I think when it come to trends I pay very close attention to fashion (runways and streetwear) because the colors/textures/typography often make their way into graphic design and UI some months later. I try to pay attention to what’s happening in Asia and Europe because I have a theory that trends move east to west.  Or, I should say, at least I’ve noticed this going back and forth between London and New York a lot.

    **If you had a magic wand and could create the perfect job, what would the job description be?**

    Haha, is there such thing as a perfect job?

    **Is there anything you’d like to say to Adobe Flash before it goes away for good?**

    Thanks for making the music play on Firefox for all those years they refused to pay for an mp3 license and we needed an HTML5 fallback.

    **Do you have a celebrity doppleganger? If so, who is it?**

    I usually get Molly Ringwald. I don’t really see it and think it’s just because she has red hair like I do, but I’m okay with that. She’s pretty dope.

    **You seem like one smart cookie, so we have to ask you a question that’s been bothering us: where’s Waldo?**

    He’s in Atlanta for Web Afternoon, baby!

    **Finish this sentence: The best part of waking up is…?**

    When it’s afternoon.

  bio: |
    If you’re building your own design studio, Tara Victoria is someone you’ll want to pay close attention to. As a graphic designer, she’s run the typical route -- graduate school, freelance, big agency work, small agency work -- ultimately to realize that where she really wanted to be was at home, running her own design shop and working for herself. Tara is the founder of [Hatch & Harbour Design Studio](http://www.hatchandharbour.com/) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where she specializes in branding and print media as she works with small businesses that have a big passion to create lasting and meaningful brands. Tara is also the author of a widely-read blog that focuses on design and fitness, two of Tara’s favorite things.

    Tara is doing what we all long to do: running a design studio on her terms, and all from her perfect place to live. She has built an amazing body of work over the past 8 years and is living proof that you don't have to live in NYC or SF to do great work and get noticed. Tara is coming to Web Afternoon to teach us how to follow in her footsteps, and to share insights she’s learned along her journey toward running her own shop.
  talk-title: Remember Why You Started
  talk-description: |
    To remain authentic in a world that thrives on social media popularity, rapidly growing businesses, and viral fame, it is imperative that we constantly reflect on our beginnings - our “where,” our “why,” and and our “how.” True passion holds story at it's core, and the very expression of our stories can become the reason clients relate and gravitate toward working with us. As our creative journey unfolds and we grow from where we started, our “why” constantly evolves. When our “whys” take new shapes, our process can be directly affected. This talk sheds light on how to look inward at the fire inside for a creative life, why we should never settle, and, most importantly, the great significance of our stories.
  interview: |
    **Tara, most people know you’re a designer and a photographer, but many don’t realize you’re a successful blogger as well. Tell us about your blog, and its growth.**

    I started my blog in 2012, as a sort of creative outlet for myself. I was stuck in a miserable job, and I needed to work on something for ME. Since its start, the blog has grown tremendously, almost taking on a life of its own — I definitely wasn’t expecting this kind of growth. It started off as a lifestyle and design blog, and over the last three years it’s morphed into more of a design and fitness blog. An added bonus? I’ve added a lot of design clients as a direct result of them connecting with me via my blog.


    **You’re so highly respected in the design community, and we’d love to hear a bit about the way you work. Can you take a moment and describe your creative process?**

    Oh, wow, that’s an interesting question. In terms of my branding process (branding is my specialty), I typically begin by interviewing my client so I can get to know his/her needs. I send over a Client Questionnaire, and their answers help me learn more about the business, goals, and brand vision.

    The next step in my process is to build a mood board. It’s a critical part of the process because I use it as a checkpoint to make sure the client is happy with the direction we’re headed.

    From there I’ll create several potential logo ideas, a few of which the client will select to be built out. Once the final logo is selected, it’s revised until we’re satisfied. It’s at this point that we build out the rest of the brand (because creating a brand is so much more than simply designing a logo): styled photography, hand lettering, custom icons, illustrations, and any deliverables.


    **What are some questions you ask when you’re considering taking on a new project?**

    When someone comes to me for help with branding, I really want to know if they understand the importance of the branding process as a whole. A brand is not just a logo; it’s so much more. I explain my own process, and if they understand and want to move ahead, then it’s a go. I’ve also learned over the years that I need to trust my gut. I have a pretty good feel at this point for whether or not a client and I will work well together.


    **What industry sites/blogs to you read regularly?**

    - [The Fresh Exchange](http://thefreshexchangeblog.com), by Mike and Megan Gilger

    **What apps do you use daily?**

    First, and most importantly, [VSCO Cam](https://vsco.co/store/vscocam). It’s my heart, and I love it so, so much. I also love the [ScannerPro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-scan-any-document/id333710667?mt=8) app. It vectorizes drawings, and it’s super helpful for the work I do.


    **Do you have a favorite design tool?**

    Hands down, it’s Adobe’s [InDesign](http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html). Love it, love it, love it!


    **Who are some of your design heroes?**

    - [Aaron Draplin, [Draplin Design Co.](http://www.draplin.com/work/)

    **Do you have a celebrity doppleganger?**

    Some people have said I look like Anne Hathaway. So...yeah.


    **If you had amnesia and then were cured, would you remember that you forgot?**
    
    Gosh, I hope so. I think so, actually. I’m pretty sure it happened in my soap opera once!
